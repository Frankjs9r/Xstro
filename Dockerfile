# We are building via Node.js 24 Package
# We install FFmpeg, Git, and other tools
# We ensure Yarn is installed for Baileys transpilation or build
# Other tools will support building packages like Sharp
# We use the latest and most recommended tool — pnpm — for efficient package installs
# We clone the repository and install dependencies using pnpm
# Finally, we start the application using pnpm
