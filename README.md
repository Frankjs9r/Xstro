### Panel Pterodactyl Server

1. Download the panel deployment file [here.](https://github.com/AstroX11/Pterodactyl-Deploy/raw/refs/heads/main/deploy.zip)
2. Ensure you have created [Pterodactyl Account](https://pterodactyl.io/)
3. Create your server and [Watch a Tutorial](https://github.com/AstroX11/Pterodactyl-Deploy/raw/refs/heads/main/help.mp4) if you don't know how to deploy on it.

### Manual Start (VPS/Ubuntu/Windows)

1. Follow the installation steps above.
2. Set up your configuration as shown below.
3. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `config.env` file or rename the existing `config.env.example` to `config.env`:

   ```bash

   BOT_NAME=Xstro
   PROXY=156.228.115.84:3128
